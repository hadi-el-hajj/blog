      <description>Review of the HYper-Reality video ! Hyper reality presents multiple scenarios where the user is subjected to potential dangers, from which we can cite both being hacked and being bombarbed by waves and waves of commercials. This said, it is too short to englobe all the possibility of dangers, which include:
  being trolled on the internet. Imagine posting a social media post and receiving such criticism that you become an internet meme.</description>

<meta name="twitter:description" content="Hey there ! My name is Hadi and I love engineering, building impactful projects, and solving problems I see around me.
I love computer science, physics, math, and I would do everything to get my hands on a meaningful project that gets near one of these subjects.
I also love companies with noble goals, with impactful missions and great leaders. After all, companies are created to solve problems, should it be a demand problem, or a more complex one like colonizing space or saving the earth."/>

<h1>About</h1>
<p>Hey there ! My name is Hadi and I love engineering, building impactful projects, and solving problems I see around me.</p>
<p>I love computer science, physics, math, and I would do everything to get my hands on a meaningful project that gets near one of these subjects.</p>
<p>I also love companies with noble goals, with impactful missions and great leaders. After all, companies are created to solve problems, should it be a demand problem, or a more complex one like colonizing space or saving the earth.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that engineers are magicians, for they can use their capabilities to literally change millions of people&rsquo;s lives, and get us as a specie, closer to the truth.</p>
<p>Via this blog, I will try and give you a glimpse of the many learnings and projects I take part in throughout my lifelong journey of becoming a better engineer. I may discuss a lot of different subjects at times, depending on my curiosity and my appetite for subjects at the moment of writing.</p>
<p>I am open to meaningful discussions, questions or any request you may have.</p>
<p>Do not hesitate to shoot me an email at <strong><a href="mailto:hadi.el-hajj@polytechnque.edu">hadi.el-hajj@polytechnque.edu</a></strong> for any enquiry, I guarantee I will respond !</p>
<p>Also, do not hesitate to check <a href="https://github.com/hadi-el-hajj/">my github</a>, for I frequently update it with my most recent projects !</p>
<p>Hope you like what I do ! Take care !</p>

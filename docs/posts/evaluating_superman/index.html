<h1>Evaluating the Superman Locomotion Technique</h1>

Mar. 4, 2021


<br/><br/>
<p>As you have seen in my previous blog post, <strong>VR Locomotion Pitch</strong>, I have chosen the Superman Locomotion technique as the technique I will be implementing and evaluating.</p>
<p>For the implementation part, check my <strong>VR Locomotion Implementation</strong> blog.</p>
<p>The evaluation process always starts by deciding which variables we are going to assess and focus on to determine wether our technique is good or not.</p>
<p>The variables I went by were the following:<br>
-<strong>Average time per round</strong> (average over all three participants)<br>
-<strong>Average accuracy per round</strong> (average over all three participants)<br>
-<strong>Average amount of finished rounds</strong> (average over all three participants)<br>
-<strong>Simulator Sickness</strong> evaluated using the following single item question: “On a scale from 1 to 10, how much motion sickness do you perceive right now” (1 lowest 10 highest)<br>
-<strong>Presence</strong> evaluated using the following single item question:“On a scale from 1 to 10 how present did you feel in the virtual world” (1 lowest 10 highest)<br>
-<strong>Enjoyment</strong> using:“On a scale from 1 to 10, how much fun did you have during the task ” (1 lowest 10 highest)</p>
<p>I additionally asked my participants to provide some open comments about the experience they have had, and what they would change and ameliorate. I will bring them back at the end of this post.</p>
<p>I stored the data in a word file first off before submitting it on the class&rsquo;s google document to compare it with other students methods and results. The picture below shows the results of my three participants, Rami, Maroun and myself, as noted on a first draft.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/evaluation.png" alt="Evaluation document"></p>
<p>The figures below depict how my technique compares to that of the other students in terms of the variables cited above, after submission :
<img src="/blog/roundTime.png" alt="Average Time per Round">
<img src="/blog/averageAccuracy.png" alt="Average Accuracy per Round">
<img src="/blog/finishedRounds.png" alt="Average Amount of Finished Rounds">
<img src="/blog/simulatorSickness.png" alt="Simulator Sickness evaluation">
<img src="/blog/averagePresence.png" alt="Presence Evaluation">
<img src="/blog/enjoyment.png" alt="Enjoyment"></p>
<p><strong>In light of these results, my technique was quite enjoyable, made the participants feel very present and their accuracy and time were great ! The main drawback is that it was also quite sickening (although not as much as I expected !).</strong></p>
<h2 id="open-comments">Open Comments</h2>
<p>Some open feedback I received from my participants was:<br>
-They wished they could have a longer trajectory so they can get to experience the technique on a more lengthy duration of time.<br>
-They said they were having less and less fun because of the repetition, and that some change would be nice.<br>
-They said that overall the game was very fun, but they would have added some special effect for boost and superpowers.<br>
-They wished they were able to do multiple laps, with coins resetiing each time they cross the finish line so they can collect more and more.<br>
-They wished they could see hands on the screen and not controllers.</p>
<p>These are definitely paths that are very compelling and interesting to go through !</p>

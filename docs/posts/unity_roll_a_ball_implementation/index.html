<h1>Unity Roll a Ball Implementation</h1>

Mar. 6, 2021


<br/><br/>
<p>This post describes briefly how I implemented Roll a Ball in Unity, what difficulties I faced as a beginner and how I overcame them. Additionally in the end you can find some captures I took of the Unity screen and the game screen.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-rall-a-ball-">What is Rall a Ball ?</h2>
<p>Roll a Ball is a minigame where the player controls a small ball and has to roll it to collect the most <em>collectibles</em> possible (which can take any form possible), hence the name. The player is, of course, bound in a space so he could not roll the ball outside the playing field. The player can move in any direction he wishes to.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it, it is simple game, but is a great way to start learning about the Unity environment (as a developer). By going through the process of implementing the game, I learned a lot about how objects, assets, etc. were coordinated in the Unity environment ! <strong>It is a great way to start that I recommend.</strong></p>
<h2 id="references-that-helped-me-with-the-implementation">References that helped me with the implementation</h2>
<ul>
<li>My classe&rsquo;s Tutorial Slide Deck</li>
<li>Unity&rsquo;s tutorial available at <strong><a href="https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/setting-up-the-game?uv=2019.4&amp;projectId=5f158f1bedbc2a0020e51f0d">https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/setting-up-the-game?uv=2019.4&amp;projectId=5f158f1bedbc2a0020e51f0d</a></strong></li>
<li>Unity&rsquo;s YouTube Channel</li>
</ul>
<p>Following through with the tutorials in these references, it was fairly easy to implement the game, but I ran nonetheless into some challenges I will describe next.</p>
<h2 id="difficulties">Difficulties</h2>
<p>All steps were easy until when I had to duplicate the collectibles. It was not hard creating the collectibles, but rather
moving them around the scene to place them right (my choice was to place them in a circle). There was a little catch. I had to change the Toggle Tool - Gizmo - to Global (from local), so the
object moves as I wish (parallel to the ground) when looking at it through the Y-Axis. I found this catch through Unity&rsquo;s
tutorial videos on youtube, specifically: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlDGSStxuHI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlDGSStxuHI</a></p>
<p>No problems afterwards for scene reproduction.</p>
<p>Then came the time to build, run and test the game.
The game built fine but I observed no movement when keys were pressed, as if the key press events were not taken into account.
To resolve the problem, I had to recreate a new input actions file after writing the scripts, so the play button would appear on its icon (which was not apparent before for one reason or another) (see figure below).

<p>All worked fine after this last step and I was able to run and play the game !</p>

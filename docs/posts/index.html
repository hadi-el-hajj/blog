                This post will mainly cover how I went from my intial idea pitch (read more in my Locomotion Technique Pitch post) to the implementation of the technique.
As you may know, scripts are implemented in C# in Unity. The post will then contain snippets of C# code followed by an explanation of why I made the choices I made regarding the method of implementation.
The full code is available on: https://github.

                This post describes briefly how I implemented Roll a Ball in Unity, what difficulties I faced as a beginner and how I overcame them. Additionally in the end you can find some captures I took of the Unity screen and the game screen.
What is Rall a Ball ? Roll a Ball is a minigame where the player controls a small ball and has to roll it to collect the most collectibles possible (which can take any form possible), hence the name.

                In this post, I will walk you through my pitch slide deck. The deck was intended to give insight on the locomotion technique I had chosen to implement, as well as why I had chosen this method in particular and the goal of said method.

                This post is dedicated to showcasing my final presentation and what it contained (slide deck mainly). My presentation tried to cover the following three topics:
The concept : Focusing on the idea of the interaction - For more info please refer to the Locomotion Technique Pitch post I made
Implementation : Explaining the logic behind my implementation and challenges that I had during the implementation and how I solved them - For more info please refer to the Locomotion Technique Implementation post I made

                Setting Unity was not very hard. Nonetheless, it is great to have a simple guide at your disposition upon installation so you can go faster. I will lay it out for you !
REMARK : I love using Linux, but unfortunately Unity is not fully supported there yet. So if you are indeed using the Linux OS, I would recommend you use windows or mac instead. Nonetheless, keep checking the unity website for updates, the launch of the Linux supported version should be released in 2021 !

                Installing Hugo ! Installing Hugo was not hard since I was using Linux. This said, I did encounter some difficulties with version updates. I wanted at first to use Introduction, but the theme needed higher versions of HUgo. After figuring out how to upgrade the distribution I had (see images below of the problem as mentioned on Stack Overflow) (a simple sudo apt&hellip; did not work, installing hugo through Ubuntu Software neither) and getting Introduction to build, I had another issue which is cited on the theme&rsquo;s Github page, but I was already a bit off the theme and just wanted to choose a new one at this stage.

                Review of Ivan Sutherland&rsquo;s THE ULTIMATE DISPLAY This blog post is intended to try and analyze how Sutherland&rsquo;s Ultimate Display fits into the Reality-Virtuality Continuum of Milgram. First, let me import the representation of the RV continuum:
In the light of this refresher, it feels that Sutherland&rsquo;s ultimate display traces the lines between a Real Environment and a Virtual Environment, and thus is surrounding the continuum.
In fact, Sutherland talks extensively about the relashionship between virtual environments and real environments, and the fact that virtual environments can make us apprehend more and more what can and cannot happen in the real world.

                Review of the HYper-Reality video ! Hyper reality presents multiple scenarios where the user is subjected to potential dangers, from which we can cite both being hacked and being bombarbed by waves and waves of commercials. This said, it is too short to englobe all the possibility of dangers, which include:
  being trolled on the internet. Imagine posting a social media post and receiving such criticism that you become an internet meme.

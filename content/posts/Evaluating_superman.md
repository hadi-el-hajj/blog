As you have seen in my previous blog post, **VR Locomotion Pitch**, I have chosen the Superman Locomotion technique as the technique I will be implementing and evaluating. 

For the implementation part, check my **VR Locomotion Implementation** blog. 

The evaluation process always starts by deciding which variables we are going to assess and focus on to determine wether our technique is good or not. 

The variables I went by were the following: \
-**Average time per round** (average over all three participants) \
-**Average accuracy per round** (average over all three participants) \
-**Average amount of finished rounds** (average over all three participants) \
-**Simulator Sickness** evaluated using the following single item question: “On a scale from 1 to 10, how much motion sickness do you perceive right now” (1 lowest 10 highest) \
-**Presence** evaluated using the following single item question:“On a scale from 1 to 10 how present did you feel in the virtual world” (1 lowest 10 highest) \
-**Enjoyment** using:“On a scale from 1 to 10, how much fun did you have during the task ” (1 lowest 10 highest)

I additionally asked my participants to provide some open comments about the experience they have had, and what they would change and ameliorate. I will bring them back at the end of this post. 

I stored the data in a word file first off before submitting it on the class's google document to compare it with other students methods and results. The picture below shows the results of my three participants, Rami, Maroun and myself, as noted on a first draft.

The figures below depict how my technique compares to that of the other students in terms of the variables cited above, after submission :

**In light of these results, my technique was quite enjoyable, made the participants feel very present and their accuracy and time were great ! The main drawback is that it was also quite sickening (although not as much as I expected !).**

## Open Comments 
Some open feedback I received from my participants was: \
-They wished they could have a longer trajectory so they can get to experience the technique on a more lengthy duration of time. \
-They said they were having less and less fun because of the repetition, and that some change would be nice. \
-They said that overall the game was very fun, but they would have added some special effect for boost and superpowers. \
-They wished they were able to do multiple laps, with coins resetiing each time they cross the finish line so they can collect more and more. \
-They wished they could see hands on the screen and not controllers. 

These are definitely paths that are very compelling and interesting to go through !

# Review of the HYper-Reality video !

 Hyper reality presents multiple scenarios where the user is subjected to potential dangers, from which we can cite both being hacked and being bombarbed by waves and waves of commercials.
This said, it is too short to englobe all the possibility of dangers, which include:

- being trolled on the internet. Imagine posting a social media post and receiving such criticism that you become an internet meme. How would you shut the trolls that follow you digitally through life, if all you do depends on the VR platform that you use ? This scenario is abusive in the sense it exposes you as well as your personal life to continuous digital presence, which can lead to anxiety, stress and of course to users invading your personal digital space (and there can be lots of them, in the case of internet trolls). Then the only way to shut that down is to restart the system, and choose a new identity, which results in the loss of all you have done and all your points.
  One way to avoid this trajectory can be what is done in the decentralized social network, Twetch, which makes you pay in crypto (BSV) to respond to a person's twetch (which is a special case of a tweet), thus limiting your capabilities as a Troll. You would have to pay from your own money to harass someone.

  Below is an example of a twetch profile with a wallet balance and total money earned:

- being ranked by your government. And yes, this started in China as you may recall. People with the most points in the community are ranked best while others sink digitally in the rankings and socially in real life, as they are exposed by their government as the worst citizens of all, which cuts all ties they have to society, since no one would ever talk to them anymore. It is a step
towards losing your freedom as a citizen, but also being controlled by your governing authority since it will most certainly have the choice of what brings more points and what brings none.
  This scenario can be avoided if each person's points balance is private and only they can see it, as well as if the points are attributed to objects or actions throughout a universal consensus, i.e. approval from the majority of the citizens.

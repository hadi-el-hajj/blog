I lately got into learning reactive programming, especailly **RxJS**, and in this post, I will be listing resources I found very insightful for beginners.

## List of links
First off, you can start by reading the very good primer which is avaiable on [Learn RxJS](https://learnrxjs.io). Follow this link: \
[RxJs Primer](https://www.learnrxjs.io/learn-rxjs/concepts/rxjs-primer)

I would then recommend you read **The introduction to Reactive Programming you've been missing**: \
[Intro to reactive programming](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754)

Once you've got a glimpse of how you can use observables and how operators work, you can use either of the two visualizing tools, **Rx Marbles** or **Rx Visualizer** to deepen your understanding of some of the operators you have just seen, or to check others ! 
- [Marbles](https://rxmarbles.com/)
- [Visualizer](https://rxviz.com/examples/mouse-move)

Also, it is always a good practice to get your eyes on the official documentation from time to time and read through it to further deepen your understanding of the concepts once you have had a simpler introduction: \

## This is not the end

Setting Unity was not very hard. Nonetheless, it is great to have a simple guide at your disposition upon installation so you can go faster. I will lay it out for you ! 

<span style="color:red"> REMARK : I love using Linux, but unfortunately Unity is not fully supported there yet. So if you are indeed using the Linux OS, I would recommend you use windows or mac instead. Nonetheless, keep checking the unity website for updates, the launch of the Linux supported version should be released in 2021 ! </span>

## Downloading Unity
THe way I did it was fairly simple:

- Go to the **Unity download page** on any browser (cf image below) : 

![Unity Download Page](/blog/unityDownloadPage.png)

- Press on **choose your Unity + download**, which will lead you to a page where you can choose your plan. You may see just above the plans mentioned, two tabs titled *Teams* and *Individual* respectively. As you are working alone on your project, select **Individual** which will lead you to the following screen :

- Here you may be tempted to sign up as a student, but as you need verification, it is much simpler to go with the personal version for your project ! Thus, press on **getting started** which will lead you to the following page:

- If you are a first time user like I was, then press on **start here**, which will prompt you to download Unity Hub. Download, install and run the tool. If you followed closely all the instructions, you should have reached this screen, which is Unity Hub's launch screen:

Following one by one through the instructions given on this screen should set you up easily for Unity. This procedure leads to a microgame creation tutorial, but you can skip through it and work only on your project. I would advise to go through the tutorial, because it helps you understand the mechanisms of Unity rapidly so you can start working right away without difficulties. 

**And that's it, I hope you could follow this tutorial without any problems ! Happy coding/gaming !**

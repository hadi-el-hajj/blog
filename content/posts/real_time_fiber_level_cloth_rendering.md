This post intends to share images from a project I loved working on, and which helped me understand the rendering pipeline in 3D graphics much more than I did before. 

**I implemented parts of the paper Real Time Fiber-Level Cloth Rendering, which you can find [here](http://people.csail.mit.edu/kuiwu/RTFR/rtfr.pdf) !**

The repository can be found on [my GitHub](https://github.com/hadi-el-hajj/Real-time-Fiber-Level-Cloth-Rendering) ! PLease cite both me and the author of the paper if you happen to use or be inspired by my code !

To check the **full report**, which also contains explanations and an introduction to the project, please follow [this link to the PDF](https://github.com/hadi-el-hajj/Real-time-Fiber-Level-Cloth-Rendering/blob/main/Project%20Report.pdf).

Photos coming soon ! To look at the photos on my GitHub, follow [this link](https://github.com/hadi-el-hajj/Real-time-Fiber-Level-Cloth-Rendering/tree/main/Additional%20images) !

Hey there ! My name is Hadi and I love engineering, building impactful projects, and solving problems I see around me. 

I love computer science, physics, math, and I would do everything to get my hands on a meaningful project that gets near one of these subjects. 

I also love companies with noble goals, with impactful missions and great leaders. After all, companies are created to solve problems, should it be a demand problem, or a more complex one like colonizing space or saving the earth.

I firmly believe that engineers are magicians, for they can use their capabilities to literally change millions of people's lives, and get us as a specie, closer to the truth. 

Via this blog, I will try and give you a glimpse of the many learnings and projects I take part in throughout my lifelong journey of becoming a better engineer. I may discuss a lot of different subjects at times, depending on my curiosity and my appetite for subjects at the moment of writing. 

I am open to meaningful discussions, questions or any request you may have. 

Do not hesitate to shoot me an email at **hadi.el-hajj@polytechnque.edu** for any enquiry, I guarantee I will respond !

Also, do not hesitate to check [my github](https://github.com/hadi-el-hajj/), for I frequently update it with my most recent projects !

Hope you like what I do ! Take care !
